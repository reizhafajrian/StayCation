Hello I really like writing code and solving problems, I can write code in many programming languages ​​because I am interested in trying new things, then I think the programming language is very similar from one language to another so it's easy to learn, even though it's a lot code that I write in various programming languages ​​but I decided to explore a few programming languages ​​such as javascript, kotlin, java, and python, the reason I focus on this language is because they can all be used on many platforms, I have some experience in development Mobile and web applications, I once had the opportunity to become a team developer of the gravote application, which is an application for voting to be used for my campus, for the experience of creating a website I had an experience at one of the Indonesian startups in Yogyakarta called latih.id, then I has several personal projects such as ordering applications bus tickets, and concert ticket booking websites, created a dashboard using react.js using a library called core.ui then I made the app and web connected in the payment system via midtrans
